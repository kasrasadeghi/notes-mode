* design decisions
** nodes vs node+files
- files end in .org, folders end in /
- we'll accomodate nodes+files using the above rule, but we'll just have nodes
- *winner*: nodes
** trajectories vs names
- names are good
- trajectories enforce structure, not flexible
- trajectories create excess coupling
- *winner*: names
* features
- add nodes
- collapsable
- traversible
- links to other stuff
- tags
- search
- images
- filters
- keyboard support
* overarching goals
- prefer text, not images
  - emulate emacs in general
- try to emulate zenburn theme
